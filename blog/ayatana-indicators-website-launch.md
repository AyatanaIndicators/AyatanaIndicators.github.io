The Ayatana Indicators project website is now live! We'll be
using this site to share project updates and reference material.

The Ayatana Indicators project is the continuation of [Application
Indicators](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopExperienceTeam/ApplicationIndicators),
a technology developed by [Canonical](https://www.canonical.com/) for
the [Unity](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity) desktop. We intend to
become the new upstream for application indicators and associated
projects, with a focus on making Ayatana Indicators a desktop agnostic
technology.

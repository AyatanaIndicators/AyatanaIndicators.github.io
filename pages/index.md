**The Ayatana Indicators project is the continuation of [Application
Indicators](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopExperienceTeam/ApplicationIndicators),
a technology developed by [Canonical](https://www.canonical.com/) for
the [Unity](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity) desktop.**

Application Indicators are a GNOME implementation of the
[StatusNotifierItem
Specification](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/StatusNotifierItem/)
(SNI) that was originally submitted to freedesktop.org by
[KDE](https://kde.org). The Ayatana Indicator project intends to become
the new upstream for application indicators and associated projects
with a focus on making Ayatana Indicators a desktop agnostic
technology.

Read [our about page](/about/) to learn more about what indicators are
and why this project was started.

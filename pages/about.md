This page provides a brief history lesson as to what indicators are and
how this project came to be.

### What are Indicators anyway?

The panel indicator area was introduced in an early version of GNOME
somewhat based on the Microsoft Windows '95 design, as an area
dedicated to notifications. It is often called the systray or the
notification area.

Prior to Indicators the notification area was difficult for users to
interact with, each application behaved differently, were not
accessible and were often styled differently.

Indicators migrated the different applets to simple menus, this
change provided a more consistent interface and improved the user
experience of interacting with panel indicators.

If you are still wondering what the heck Indicators are, this image from
Ubuntu MATE should help.

### Why Ayatana Indicators?

Canonical announced the discontinuation of Unity on the desktop and
mobile devices in April 2017. As Ubuntu shifts its focus to GNOME,
which is dropping the panel indicator concept entirely, it is fair
assumption that upstream maintainence of application indicators and
related technologies will decline or come to end entirely.

There are a number of projects that are already using indicators and/or
it's associated libraries such as [MATE
Desktop](https://mate-desktop.org), [XFCE](https://xfce.org) and
[Arctica Greeter](https://github.com/ArcticaProject/arctica-greeter).
The [UBports](https://ubports.com/) project has also expressed
interest. These projects all really like the indicator concept and wish
to see it maintained and continued.

To better understand the origins of the project and the goals for the
future you can hear it from the Ayatana Indicator project lead, [Mike
Gabriel](https://sunweavers.net), from his [Ayatana Indicators talk at
DebConf17](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/168/).
